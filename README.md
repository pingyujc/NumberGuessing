# NumberGuessing

Started with the python file, I wanted to build a simple webpage that can let users play the number guessing game.
I eneded up making it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I hosted the project using netlify: https://num-guessingg.netlify.app/

all parameters are modifiable in the JS file.
